  **CZDM (Cyberzilla Download Manager)** is a high-performance, open-source browser extension designed to accelerate download speeds using advanced multi-threading technology. It features a robust file assembly engine to prevent corruption, a smart media grabber, and a modern, user-friendly interface.

  Built for Chromium-based browsers (Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Brave, Opera).

  ## 🌟 Key Features

  * **🚀 Multi-Threaded Engine:** Splits files into multiple chunks (up to 8 threads) to maximize bandwidth usage and download speed.
  * **🛡️ Corruption-Proof Architecture:** Utilizes an **Offset-based IndexedDB** storage system. This ensures chunks are assembled based on their exact byte position, guaranteeing 100% data integrity even if threads finish out of order.
  * **⏯️ Resume Capability:** Pause and resume downloads anytime without losing progress (requires server support for byte-ranges).
  * **🔍 Smart Media Grabber:** Automatically scans active webpages for video, audio, images, and archives. Includes "Select All" and filtering capabilities.
  * **📋 Smart Paste:** Automatically detects valid URLs from your clipboard when opening the "Add URL" modal.
  * **🧩 Large File Support:** Leverages the **Offscreen API** and **Blob Assembly** to handle large files (GBs) efficiently without crashing browser memory.
  * **🎨 Modern UI:** A unified, clean interface with Dark/Light mode support, consistent styling across Dashboard and Grabber, and a native app feel (context menu disabled).

  2.  **Manage Downloads:**
      * **Start:** Resume or start selected tasks.
      * **Pause:** Pause running tasks.
      * **Delete:** Remove tasks from the list (prompts for confirmation).

  3.  **Clear:** Removes all "Completed" or "Error" tasks from the list to clean up the view.

  ### Smart Grabber
  1.  Navigate to any website containing media (images, videos, archives).
  2.  Open the extension and switch to the **Grabber** tab.
  3.  Click **Start Scan**.
  4.  Use the **Filter** box to find specific file types (e.g., `mp4`, `jpg`).
  5.  Check the boxes for the files you want (or use **Select All**) and click **Download**.

  ## 🔒 Permissions Explained

  * `storage` / `unlimitedStorage`: To store temporary file chunks in IndexedDB before assembly.
  * `offscreen`: To process large blobs in the background without freezing the UI.
  * `activeTab` / `scripting`: Required for the Smart Grabber to scan the current page.
  * `clipboardRead`: Enables the "Smart Paste" button in the Add URL modal.
